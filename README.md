This is a test of Terra Invicta mission modding.

The mod adds a new type of mission - Defend All Interests, which works like Defend Interests, but protects all points, controlled by faction. By default, Resistance has
a councilor with that mission from start, but any Activist-type councilor may have it.

Requires Unity Mod Manager.
